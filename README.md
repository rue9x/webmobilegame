webmobilegame

This is my attempt to make a city builder, rpg battling, mobile-type web game using Django, Python, and Javascript. The goal is to come out with something
that demonstrates the use of a full stack, complete with an authentication system, payment setup, a fully playable game, and community features.

It's in early development right now. gameidea.txt contains the game design ideas. It requires django and python. In the final version, a more secure
database than SQLite will be utilized.
